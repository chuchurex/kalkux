# Claude Code — project instructions

Read and follow `.github/AGENTS.md` before any work. It defines commit style,
branch naming, PR workflow, and code rules for this repo.

## Quick reference

- Commits: imperative verb in English, no prefixes. `Add`, `Fix`, `Replace`, `Update`, `Remove`.
- No `Co-Authored-By`. No AI session links.
- Author: `chuchurex <chuchurex@gmail.com>`.
- Never commit to `main`. Always branch + PR.
- One PR per issue. Reference with `Closes #N`.
- Vanilla JS only. No npm dependencies for the engine.

## Internal docs

Session log and extended workflow notes are in `.internal/WORKFLOW.md` (local only, gitignored).
Read it at the start of each session for context on past work.
